location does not have description
    we could add region as an entity and connect to location

need location-area for pokemon encounter relationship
    new location-area and pokemon table for many to many
    location-area will have fk to location

version should be version_group instead
    the api does not contain release date

need a generation entity which will connect to version_group
    Generation will be 1 and version-group will be many
